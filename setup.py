    # List run-time dependencies here.  These will be installed by pip when
    # your project is installed. For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's
    # requirements files see:
    # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/requirements.html
    # Note: dependancies are NOT honoured. providing, e.g.:
    # install_requires=['numpy', 'obspy'],
    # it apparently downloads numpy, then obspy, THEN INSTALLS both
    # so that, since obspy requires numpy, it complains that's not installed.
    # numpy must be therefore installed separately, and we write:
    install_requires=["pandas", "Flask", "Sphinx", "matplotlib", # "obspy",
                      "jinja2", "lxml", "beautifulsoup4"],
                      # note: if you remove obspy THEN you need to add matplotlib!!

    # List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development
    # dependencies). You can install these using the following syntax,
    # for example:
    # $ pip install -e .[dev,test]
    extras_require={
        # 'dev': ['check-manifest'],
        'test': ['pep8', 'pylint', 'pytest', 'pytest-cov'],

    # If there are data files included in your packages that need to be
    # installed, specify them here.  If using Python 2.6 or less, then these
    # have to be included in MANIFEST.in as well.
    #
    # package_data={
    #    'sample': ['package_data.dat'],
    # },

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
    # http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files # noqa
