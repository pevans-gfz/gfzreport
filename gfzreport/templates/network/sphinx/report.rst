.. TITLE:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Section titles are set by decorating a SINGLE line of text with under- (and optionally over-)
   line characters WHICH MUST BE AT LEAST AS LONG AS the section title length.
   There is no rule about which decoration characters to use, but equal decorations are interpreted
   as same "level": thus two chapter titles must have the same decorations, a chapter and a section
   must not

{{ title }}

.. FIELDS:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Here below the document "fields" (authors, revision, etcetera): they are used as special
   variables for latex output and rendered according to templating rules you don't have to care about.
   They are in the form:
   :fieldname: fieldbody
   The ":fieldname: " part (including the trailing whitespace) is called the field marker:
   Please NEVER MODIFY (or DELETE) field markers. The field body on the other hand can contain:
   - newlines, indented relative to the field marker
   - colons, if they are escaped with a backslash: "\:"
   - multiple body elements, but note that raw text and raw urls only have been tested succesfully.

   they aligned (in case of true north Gyrocompass or magnetic compass
   with correction). If magnetic compass was used, what was the magnetic
   declination at the time of the experiment and how was it
   determined. Note that GFZ provides a declination calculator at
   http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/earths-magnetic-field/data-products-services/igrf-declination-calculator/
   Please verify that the sensor orientation in the GEOFON database (see table below)

.. end of the document content. Below figures and tables added by means of rst directives

.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. DIRECTIVES:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Rst "directives" are explicit markup blocks for generating special document objects, like
   figures and tables. They are in the form ".. directivetype::" and includes all subsequent
   INDENTED lines (see e.g. the ".. math::" directive above). A typical example to include a figure is:
   
   .. _figure-label:
   
   .. figure:: ./larch.png
      :width: 33%
      :align: center

      caption
   
   ".. _figure-label:" is the figure label, used to reference the figure via :numerf:`figure_label`
   - "./larch.png" is called the directive argument
   - ":width: 33%" and ":align: center" are directive options in the form :name: value
   - "caption" is called the directive content
   (For details, see http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#figure)

   **IMPORTANT**:
   1. In the following, with "directive block" (or simply block) we will denote the directive AND its
   label (if any).
   2. A directive block must be always preceeded and followed by a blank line. Always.
   3. Only a blank line, not even comments, can be input between a label and
   its directive
   4. From within the web application only, NEVER edit:
      - file paths as they are relative to this document path on the server.
      - option names, as they might break the document build.
      Everything else (non-file argument, non-file content, option values) can be editable
   
   You can always delete / move / copy a directive BLOCK anywhere in the text.
   Non-standard Rst directives (i.e., implemented and working in this program only) are marked as
   (NonStandard) below


.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. CUSTOM DIRECTIVES (FIGURES AND TABLES)
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. 1) The first directive is the directive to display the stations information in a
   table. It's the so called 'csv-table' directive
   (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#id4):
   There are several ways to display tables in RsT. Curiously, none of them is free from drawbacks
   and limitations. Csv-tables have the advantage to be easily editable here.

.. first of all, we show the "raw" directive, which might comes handy to put
   html or latex specific commands: in this case we decrease the size of the table
   to avoid page horizontal overflow. Remove the directive or change '\scriptsize' if you need it.
   
.. raw:: latex

   \scriptsize
   
.. we use the tabularcolumns directive
   (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/latest/markup/misc.html#directive-tabularcolumns):
   this directive gives a “column spec” for the next table occurring in the source file.
   The spec is the second argument to the LaTeX tabulary package’s environment, although,
   sphinx might use different tabular environment:

.. tabularcolumns:: |@{\ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ }|


.. customize the table horizontal lines via the tabularrows directive (implemented in this
   project onyl, as of July 2017 it's not implemented in Sphinx) which applies to the next
   generated table (latex output only). You can remove the whole block to show all hlines (default in sphinx).
   The directive can have two options, 'hline-show' or 'hline-hide' (*either* one *or* the other) specifying
   the indices of the hlines to show/hide, separeted by spaces (first index is 0). You can also
   provide python slice notations in the format 'start:end' or 'start:end:step'
   (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/explain-pythons-slice-notation).
   The command might not work in some edge cases (e.g. for tables spanning over multiple pages)
   as it is a hack around a poor sphinx implementation, and might
   need some trial-and-errors for working as expected.
   Here we want  to show the first (0) and the last (-1) hlines, and each fourth hline starting from
   the second one (1::4 which means indices 1,5,9,...)
   
.. tabularrows::
   :hline-show: 0 1::4 -1

.. finally, the table directive (preceeded by its label so you can reference it via
   :numref:`stations_table`). You can edit the
   directive content[1] or the directive argument[2], as any csv file.
   [1] To provide empty strings quote them like this: "".
   [2] Text can span over several lines (providing as always the correct indentation)
   
.. _stations_table:

.. csv-table:: Station table. Note that start and end times represent the maximum validity of the
   corresponding configurations, not the actual data availability or time in the field.
   Azi: Azimuth of north or '1' component.
   :delim: space
   :quote: "
   :header-rows: 1
   
   {{ stations_table.content|indent(3) }}

.. restore normal size in latex only:

.. raw:: latex

   \normalsize


.. ==============================================================================   

.. 2) The second directive below is the (NonStandard) directive to display the station map figure.
   The syntax is similar to the csv-table directive (ses above) BUT produces an image instead.
   After the label definition (so you can reference the map figure via
   :numref:`stations_figure`), in the directive you can edit the argument (the map caption, keep
   indentation for newlines), the content as any csv file, or the directive option **values** 
   to customize the map: a full documentation of all option names is in preparation, we tried to make
   them as much self-explanatory as possible

.. _stations_figure:

.. mapfigure:: Station distribution in experiment (red symbols). If present, white-filled symbols
   show permanent stations and other temporary experiments archived at EIDA or IRIS-DMC,
   whose activity period overlapped at least partially with the time of the experiment.
   If present, open symbols show station sites which were no longer active at the time
   of the experiment, e.g. prior temporary experiments.
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: center
   :delim: space
   :quote: "
   {% for opt_name in stations_map.options -%}
   :{{ opt_name }}: {{ stations_map.options[opt_name] | safe }}
   {% endfor %}
   {{ stations_map.content|indent(3)  }}


.. ==============================================================================   

.. 3) The third directive is the (NonStandard) directive 'gridfigure' to display the noise pdfs.
   The syntax is similar to the csv-table directive (see above) BUT produces a grid of images.
   Note that in latex this will be rendered with a longtable followed by an
   empty figure with only the caption inside. This is a workaround to produce something that
   looks like a figure spanning over several pages (if needed) BUT it might need some arrangment
   as the figure caption might be placed on a different page. Being a table and a figure, all figure
   + table options, as well as all figure + table latex pre-customization (e.g. 'tabularcolumns',
   'includegraphics') apply also to a 'gridfigure'

.. first issue a raw latex command (You can remove the lines if the layout does not need a clear page):

.. raw:: latex

   \clearpage
   
.. customize latex tabularcolumns:
   
.. tabularcolumns::  @{}c@{}c@{}c@{}

.. customize the includegraphics options (only for latex output) for the next figure or image
   found (in the former case, applies the includegraphics options to all images of the figure):
   
.. includegraphics:: trim=8 30 76 0,width=0.33\textwidth,clip

.. customize also horizontal lines when rendering to latex. As usual, remove the block below to
   show all hlines. The block is mainly used as another example of the use of python slice
   notations: "a:b" means "from a until b-1". If a is missing it default to zero, if b is missing
   it defaults to the index after the last element. Thus ":" means all elements and the directive
   below hides all hlines:

.. tabularrows::
   :hline-hide: :

.. finally, the gridfigure directive (preceeded by its label so you can reference it via
   :numref:`noise_pdfs_figure`). The directive argument is the figure caption, the directive
   content holds the auto-generated pdfs placed on the server in the :dir: option (**do not change it!!**)

.. _noise_pdfs_figure:

.. gridfigure:: Noise probability density functions for all stations for database holdings
   :dir: {{ noise_pdfs.dirpath | safe  }}
   :delim: space
   :align: center
   :header-rows: 1

   {{ noise_pdfs.content|indent(3) }}
   

.. ==============================================================================   

.. 4) The fourth directive is the directive to display the instrumental uptimes.
   Depending on the number of files uploaded when generating this template, it's either a
   'figure' or a (NonStandard) 'gridfigure' directive, in any case it will be rendered as figure in
   html and latex).

.. customize the includegraphics options (only for latex output) for the next figure or image
   found (in the former case, applies the includegraphics options to all images of the figure):

{% if inst_uptimes.directive == 'gridfigure' -%}
.. includegraphics:: width=\textwidth
{% else -%}
.. includegraphics:: angle=-90,width=\textwidth
{% endif -%}

.. here the directive (preceeded by its label so you can reference it via
   :numerf:`inst_uptimes_figure`). Note that the directive type is dynamically auto generated:
   if it's a 'figure' type, you can change the directive content which is the figure
   caption. If it's a 'gridfigure' type, remember that the directive *argument*
   is the figure caption

.. _inst_uptimes_figure:

{% if inst_uptimes.directive == 'gridfigure' -%}
.. gridfigure:: Overview of uptimes of all stations generated with `obspy-scan`
   {% for opt_name in inst_uptimes.options -%}
   :{{ opt_name }}: {{ inst_uptimes.options[opt_name] | safe }}
   {% endfor -%}
   :align: center
   
   {{ inst_uptimes.content|indent(3)  }}
{% else -%}
.. figure:: {{ inst_uptimes.arg  }}
   {% for opt_name in inst_uptimes.options -%}
   :{{ opt_name }}: {{ inst_uptimes.options[opt_name] | safe }}
   {% endfor -%}
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   
   Overview of uptimes of all stations generated with `obspy-scan`
{% endif %}

    .. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    .. TEXT FORMATTING:
    .. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    This is an example of "normal" body text. It's not in a comment block.
    Remeber that indentation is a special RsT command and that newlines are actually not rendered
    (this is a newline and you shouldn't see any difference in html or latex)
    
    But you can type a new paragraph by adding an empty line above it (like in
    this case)
    
    .. italic can be rendered by wrapping text within two asterix, bold by wrapping
       text within two couples of asterix:
       
    *This is rendered in italic*, **this is rendered in bold**
    
    
    .. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    .. HYPERLINKS:
    .. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    .. Hyperlink (inline): simply type them: Urls are automatically recognized and linked:
    
    Hyperlink (inline): http://www.python.org/
    
    .. Hyperlink with substitution text: point to the same url as above but render 'Python' as text:
    
    Hyperlink with subsitution text: `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_
    
    .. Hyperlink with substitution text, if it has to be referenced more than once.
       Define the hyperlink as follows (note that the line below is NOT rendered but is NOT a comment):
       
    .. _Wikipedia: https://www.wikipedia.org/
    
    Hyperlinks with subsitution text referenced more than once: Wikipedia_, and again, Wikipedia_ 
    
    
    .. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    .. TEXT SUBSTITUTIONS:
    .. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    .. When the a text is repeated many times throughout one or more documents,
       especially if it may need to change later
       (note that the line below is NOT rendered but is NOT a comment):
    
    .. |RsT| replace:: ReStructuredText
    
    Text substitution: |RsT|
    
    .. Note that by placing a backslash before a character, you render that character
       literally. E.g., concerning the text substitution just descirbed:
    
    |RsT| was obtained by typing \|RsT\|
    
    
    .. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    .. MATH FORMULAE:
    .. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    .. Inline math formulae, use :math:`...` or latext dollar sign with latex syntax inside
       (the latter is not standard rst, but is implemented in this report):
    
    Here an inline math expression: :math:`(\alpha > \beta)` = $(\alpha > \beta)$
    
    .. More complex math formulae, use ..math:: then new empty line and INDENTED text:
    
    Here a more complex math expression:
    
    .. math::
    
       n_{\mathrm{offset}} = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} s_k n_k
    
    
    .. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

       newlines which must be indented
    
    Here a ref to the first footnote [1]_ and here to the second [2]_.
    
    .. Footnotes with auto numbering (newlines must be INDENTED of at least three spaces):

    .. [#] Second footnote (autonumbered), note that
       newlines which must be indented
    
    Here a ref to the first footnote [#]_ and here to the second [#]_.
    
    .. Footnotes with auto numbering, referenced more than once (newlines must be INDENTED of at least three spaces):

       newlines which must be indented
    
    Here a ref to the first footnote [#firstnote]_, again [#firstnote]_ and here to the second [#secondnote]_.
    
    .. Footnotes with auto symbols. DEPRECATED: seems they are buggy in latex:
    
    .. [*] First footnote (autosymbol)
