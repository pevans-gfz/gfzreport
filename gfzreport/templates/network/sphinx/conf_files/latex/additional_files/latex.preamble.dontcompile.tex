% tablecontinued is used for longtables to show the 'continued on next/previous page'
% string. Remove sfseries and make it smaller
% NOTE: tablecontinued has been replaced by sphinxtablecontinued now. sphinx 1.5.1 still generates
% \tablecontinued in its latex writer (which we override, but keeping that command)
% WHEREAS the sphinx.sty file defines a sphinxtablecontinued but apparently also
% the old tablecontinued (what A MESS. WHAT A MESS). So, as always, thanks sphinx for the hack:
%renewcommand twice for safety:
\renewcommand{\tablecontinued}[1]{\rmseries\small #1}
\renewcommand{\sphinxtablecontinued}[1]{\rmseries\small #1}
% FINAL NOTE: sphinx 1.6+ has a templating system for latex still UNDEER DEVELOPMENT.
% maybe in the future this might be handy if it will be commented and overriddable. From the doc of
% version 1.6 (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.6.3/latex.html):
% ``New in version 1.6: currently all template variables are unstable and undocumented.''

% make table headers ``normal'' (by default is \textsf in sphinx.sty)
\renewcommand{\sphinxstylethead}{\textrm}

% setup footers and headers in the "normal" document pages
% IMPORTANT NOTE: fancyhdr is required if the document class is NOT memoir, (which is set in config.py
% and is always true for this report)
\pagestyle{fancy}
% define headers and footer globally valid for everything:
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}
\renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0pt}
\lhead{} % no left header
\rhead{} % no right header
\chead{} % no center header
\lfoot{\scriptsize \rstStrNum. GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences. DOI: \rstDoi}
\cfoot{} % no center foot
\rfoot{\footnotesize \thepage} % print the page

% REMINDER:
% make title is overridden in sphinxhowto.cls (copied from original sphinx sphinxhowto)
% fancyhdr is loaded in sphinx.sty
