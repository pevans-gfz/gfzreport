   This is a RsT (ReStructuredText) file and also a comprehensive tutorial
   which might help you during editing. RsT is a lightweight markup language designed to be both
   easily readable/editable and processable by documentation-processing software (sphinx) to
   produce html, latex or pdf output

   This portion of text (".. " followed by INDENTED text) is a comment block and will not
   be rendered. The comment block ends at the first non-indented line found


.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. TITLE:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Section titles are set by decorating a SINGLE line of text with under- (and optionally over-)
   line characters WHICH MUST BE AT LEAST AS LONG AS the section title length.
   There is no rule about which decoration characters to use, but equal decorations are interpreted
   as same "level": thus two chapter titles must have the same decorations, a chapter and a section
   must not

{{ title }}

.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. FIELDS:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Here below the document "fields" (authors, revision, etcetera): they are used as special
   variables for latex output and rendered according to templating rules you don't have to care about.
   They are in the form:
   :fieldname: fieldbody
   The ":fieldname: " part (including the trailing whitespace) is called the field marker:
   Please NEVER MODIFY (or DELETE) field markers. The field body on the other hand can contain:
   - newlines, indented relative to the field marker
   - colons, if they are escaped with a backslash: "\:"
   - multiple body elements, but we strongly recommend to input raw text or urls ONLY.

.. authors. Provide the authors as comma separated items (affiliation still to be implemented):

:authors: Author1, author2, author3

.. subtitle. Filled automatically by default with the network description. Note: you
   should not specify newlines in it (same for subSubtitle below)

:subtitle: {{ network_description }}

.. sub-sub-title: this this is the (optional) sub-sub-subtitle (below the subtitle)

:subSubtitle: 

.. a revision mechanism from within the rst is currently not implemented,
   this field can be left as it is:

:revision: 1.0

.. the Scientific Technical Report (STR) number. Fill in if you know it

:strNum: 

.. the doi. Fill in if you know it. For info on the doi format see
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier#Nomenclature
   Example: http://doi.org/10.2312/GFZ.b103-xxxxx
      
:doi: 

.. The urn. Fill in if you know it.
   Example: urn\:nbn:de\:kobv\:b103-xxxxx (remember to escape colons with backslash)
   Just a side-note for developers the sphinx builder will raise a
   warning as rst interprets it urn as URL. Please ignore the warning

:urn: 

.. the issn. Fill in if you know it (e.g.: 2190-7110)

:issn: 

.. the publication year. Fill in if you know it (e.g., 2016)

:publicationYear: 

.. the publication year. Fill in if you know it (e.g., October)

:publicationMonth: 

.. this field is optional and will be rendered (in latex only) under the section
   "Supplementary datasets:" in the back of the cover page. Fill it with
   a bibliographic citation to a publication (if any)

:supplDatasets: 

.. this field is optional and will be rendered (in latex only) under the section
   "Recommended citation for chapter:" in the back of the cover page. Fill it with
   a bibliographic citation to a publication (if any)

:citationChapter: 

.. this field is optional and will be rendered (in latex only) under the section
   "The report and the datasets are supplements to:" in the back of the cover page.
   Fill it with a bibliographic citation to a publication (if any)

:supplementsTo: 

.. this is the abstract and will be rendered in latex within the 
   abstract environment (\begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}):

:abstract: write your abstract here, you can add newlines but remeber:
           you should indent
           any new line

.. The first section title (provide always an empty line above and below)

Introduction
============

.. For this section only, we provide now some text to show the user, before removing it,
   how it is rendered in html or latex. The text is also a short introduction about few rst commands.


.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. TEXT FORMATTING:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an example of "normal" body text. It's not in a comment block.
Remeber that indentation is a special RsT command and that newlines are actually not rendered
(this is a newline and you shouldn't see any difference in html or latex)

But you can type a new paragraph by adding an empty line above it (like in
this case)

.. italic can be rendered by wrapping text within two asterix, bold by wrapping
   text within two couples of asterix:
   
*This is rendered in italic*, **this is rendered in bold**


.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. HYPERLINKS:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Hyperlink (inline): simply type them: Urls are automatically recognized and linked:

Hyperlink (inline): http://www.python.org/

.. Hyperlink with substitution text: point to the same url as above but render 'Python' as text:

Hyperlink with subsitution text: `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_

.. Hyperlink with substitution text, if it has to be referenced more than once.
   Define the hyperlink as follows (note that the line below is NOT rendered but is NOT a comment):
   
.. _Wikipedia: https://www.wikipedia.org/

Hyperlinks with subsitution text referenced more than once: Wikipedia_, and again, Wikipedia_ 


.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. TEXT SUBSTITUTIONS:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. When the a text is repeated many times throughout one or more documents,
   especially if it may need to change later
   (note that the line below is NOT rendered but is NOT a comment):

.. |RsT| replace:: ReStructuredText

Text substitution: |RsT|

.. Note that by placing a backslash before a character, you render that character
   literally. E.g., concerning the text substitution just descirbed:

|RsT| was obtained by typing \|RsT\|


.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. MATH FORMULAE:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Inline math formulae, use :math:`...` or latext dollar sign with latex syntax inside
   (the latter is not standard rst, but is implemented in this report):

Here an inline math expression: :math:`(\alpha > \beta)` = $(\alpha > \beta)$

.. More complex math formulae, use ..math:: then new empty line and INDENTED text:

Here a more complex math expression:

.. math::

   n_{\mathrm{offset}} = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} s_k n_k


.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. FOOTNOTES:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Footnotes with manual numbering:

.. [1] First footnote

.. [2] Second footnote, note that
   newlines which must be indented

Here a ref to the first footnote [1]_ and here to the second [2]_.

.. Footnotes with auto numbering (newlines must be INDENTED of at least three spaces):

.. [#] First footnote (autonumbered)

.. [#] Second footnote (autonumbered), note that
   newlines which must be indented

Here a ref to the first footnote [#]_ and here to the second [#]_.

.. Footnotes with auto numbering, referenced more than once (newlines must be INDENTED of at least three spaces):

.. [#firstnote] First footnote (autonumbered, referenced more than once)

.. [#secondnote] Second footnote (autonumbered, referenced more than once), note that
   newlines which must be indented

Here a ref to the first footnote [#firstnote]_, again [#firstnote]_ and here to the second [#secondnote]_.

.. Footnotes with auto symbols. DEPRECATED: seems they are buggy in latex:

.. [*] First footnote (autosymbol)

.. [*] Second footnote (autosymbol), note that
   newlines which must be indented

Here a ref to the first footnote [*]_, and here to the second [*]_.


.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. CITATIONS:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Citations are identical to footnotes except that their labels
   must be case-insensitive single words of alphanumerics plus internal hyphens,
   underscores, and periods. No whitespace, no numeric only. E.g., CIT2002:

.. [CIT2002] Deep India meets deep Asia: Lithospheric indentation, delamination and break-off under
   Pamir and Hindu Kush (Central Asia). http://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2015.11.046

Here a reference to a publication: [CIT2002]_. And here another reference to it ([CIT2002]_)


.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. NUMERIC REFERENCES TO FIGURES AND TABLES:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Providing a label to a specific directive (e.g. figure, table, see below):
   .. _labelname
   you can reference it in the text with:
   :numref:`labelname`
   
   For instance, here you can reference the auto-generated figures and tables
   (more on this below, if you are interested)

Here a reference to :numref:`stations_table`. Here a reference to :numref:`stations_figure`.
Here a reference to :numref:`inst_uptimes_figure`. Here a reference to :numref:`noise_pdfs_figure`
   

.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. LIST ITEMS:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. bullet lists (blank line before and after the list):

- This is a bullet list.

- Bullets can be "*", "+", or "-".

.. enumerated lists (blank line before and after the list):

1. This is an enumerated list.

2. Enumerators may be arabic numbers, letters, or roman
   numerals.
   
.. nested lists (blank lines are optional between items on the same level):

.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. DIRECTIVES:
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Rst "directives" are explicit markup blocks for generating special document objects, like
   figures and tables. They are in the form ".. directivetype::" and includes all subsequent
   INDENTED lines (see e.g. the ".. math::" directive above). A typical example to include a figure is:
   
   .. _figure-label:
   
   .. figure:: ./larch.png
      :width: 33%
      :align: center

      caption
   
   ".. _figure-label:" is the figure label, used to reference the figure via :numerf:`figure_label`:
   In the following, with "directive block" (or simply block) we will denote the directive AND its
   label (if any). NOTE THAT ONLY A BLANK LINE, NOT EVEN COMMENTS, can be input between a label and
   its directive!
   - "./larch.png" is called the directive argument
   - ":width: 33%" and ":align: center" are directive options in the form :name: value
   - "caption" is called the directive content
   (For details, see http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#figure)

   From within the web application, NEVER EDIT FILE PATHS as they are relative to this
   document path on the server. Never EDIT option names, as they might break the document build.
   Everything else (non-file argument, non-file content, option values) can be editable
   
   You can always delete / move / copy a directive BLOCK anywhere in the text. 
   The block must be followed and preceeded by an empty line.
   
   Non-standard Rst directives (i.e., implemented and working in this program only) are marked as
   (NonStandard) below


.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. CUSTOM DIRECTIVES (FIGURES AND TABLES)
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. 1) The first directive is the directive to display the stations information in a
   table. It's the so called 'csv-table' directive
   (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#id4):
   There are several ways to display tables in RsT. Curiously, none of them is free from drawbacks
   and limitations. Csv-tables have the advantage to be easily editable HERE.

.. first of all, we show the "raw" directive, which might comes handy to put
   html or latex specific commands: in this case we decrease the size of the table
   to avoid page horizontal overflow. Remove the directive or change '\scriptsize' if you need it.
   
.. raw:: latex

   \scriptsize
   
.. we use the tabularcolumns directive
   (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/latest/markup/misc.html#directive-tabularcolumns):
   this directive gives a “column spec” for the next table occurring in the source file.
   The spec is the second argument to the LaTeX tabulary package’s environment, although,
   sphinx might use different tabular environment:

.. tabularcolumns:: |@{\ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ \ }l@{\ \ }|


.. customize the table horizontal lines via the (NonStandard) tabularrows directive which applies to the next
   generated table (latex output only). You can remove the whole block to show all hlines (default in sphinx).
   The directive can have two options, 'hline-show' or 'hline-hide' (*either* one *or* the other) specifying
   the indices of the hlines to show/hide, separeted by spaces (first index is 0). You can also
   provide python slice notations in the format 'start:end:step' (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/explain-pythons-slice-notation).
   The command is not perfect as it is a hack around a poor sphinx implementation, so you might need
   to fix the indices if it does not render as you want (especially for tables spanning over multiple
   pages). As an example, we want to show the first (0) and the last (-1)
   hlines, and each fourth hline starting from the second one (1::4 which means indices 1,5,9,...)
   
.. tabularrows::
   :hline-show: 0 1::4 -1

.. finally, the table directive (preceeded by its label so you can reference it via
   :numref:`stations_table`). In principle, you might want to edit the
   directive content as any csv file (the table content. To provide empty strings, quote them like this: "")
   or its argument (the table caption) which as you can see can spanning over several lines
   (providing as always the correct indentation)
   
.. _stations_table:

.. csv-table:: Station table. Note that start and end times represent the maximum validity of the
   corresponding configurations, not the actual data availability or time in the field.
   Azi: Azimuth of north or '1' component.
   :delim: space
   :quote: "
   :header-rows: 1
   
   {{ stations_table.content|indent(3) }}

.. restore normal size in latex only:

.. raw:: latex

   \normalsize


.. ==============================================================================   

.. 2) The second directive below is the (NonStandard) directive to display the station map figure.
   The syntax is similar to the csv-table directive (ses above) BUT produces an image instead.
   After the label definition (so you can reference the map figure via
   :numref:`stations_figure`), in the directive you can edit the argument (the map caption, keep
   indentation for newlines), the content as any csv file, or the directive option **values** 
   to customize the map: a full documentation of all option names is in preparation, we tried to make
   them as much self-explanatory as possible

.. _stations_figure:

.. mapfigure:: Station distribution in experiment (red symbols). If present, white-filled symbols
   show permanent stations and other temporary experiments archived at EIDA or IRIS-DMC,
   whose activity period overlapped at least partially with the time of the experiment.
   If present, open symbols show station sites which were no longer active at the time
   of the experiment, e.g. prior temporary experiments.
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: center
   :delim: space
   :quote: "
   {% for opt_name in stations_map.options -%}
   :{{ opt_name }}: {{ stations_map.options[opt_name] | safe }}
   {% endfor %}
   {{ stations_map.content|indent(3)  }}


.. ==============================================================================   

.. 3) The third directive is the (NonStandard) directive to display the noise pdfs.
   The syntax is similar to the csv-table directive (ses above) BUT produces a grid of images.
   Note that in latex this will be rendered with a longtable followed by an
   empty figure with only the caption inside. This is a workaround to produce something that
   looks like a figure spanning over several
   pages (if needed) BUT it might need some arrangment as the figure caption might be placed on a different
   page 

.. first issue a raw latex command (You can remove the lines if the layout does not need a clear page):

.. raw:: latex

   \clearpage
   
.. customize latex tabularcolumns:   
   
.. tabularcolumns:: @{}m{.33\textwidth}@{}m{.33\textwidth}@{}m{.33\textwidth}@{}

.. customize the includegraphics options (only for latex output) for the next figure or image
   found (in the former case, applies the includegraphics options to all images of the figure):
   
.. includegraphics:: trim=8 30 76 0,width=0.33\textwidth,clip
   
.. finally, the gridfigure directive (preceeded by its label so you can reference it via
   :numref:`noise_pdfs_figure`). The directive argument is the figure caption, the directive
   content holds the auto-generated pdfs placed on the server in the :dir: option (**do not change it!!**)

.. _noise_pdfs_figure:

.. gridfigure:: Noise probability density functions for all stations for database holdings
   :dir: {{ noise_pdfs.dirpath | safe  }}
   :delim: space
   :align: center
   :header-rows: 1

   {{ noise_pdfs.content|indent(3) }}
   

.. ==============================================================================   

.. 4) The fourth directive is the directive to display the instrumental uptimes.
   Depending on the number of files uploaded when generating this template, it's either a
   'figure' or a (NonStandard) 'gridfigure' directive, in any case it will be rendered as figure in
   html and latex).

.. customize the includegraphics options (only for latex output) for the next figure or image
   found (in the former case, applies the includegraphics options to all images of the figure):

{% if inst_uptimes.directive == 'gridfigure' -%}
.. includegraphics:: width=\textwidth
{% else -%}
.. includegraphics:: angle=-90,width=\textwidth
{% endif -%}

.. here the directive (preceeded by its label so you can reference it via
   :numerf:`inst_uptimes_figure`). Note that the directive type is dynamically auto generated:
   if it's a 'figure' type, you can change the directive content which is the figure
   caption. If it's a 'gridfigure' type, remember that the directive *argument*
   is the figure caption

.. _inst_uptimes_figure:

{% if inst_uptimes.directive == 'gridfigure' -%}
.. gridfigure:: Overview of uptimes of all stations generated with `obspy-scan`
   {% for opt_name in inst_uptimes.options -%}
   :{{ opt_name }}: {{ inst_uptimes.options[opt_name] | safe }}
   {% endfor -%}
   :align: center
   
   {{ inst_uptimes.content|indent(3)  }}
{% else -%}
.. figure:: {{ inst_uptimes.arg  }}
   {% for opt_name in inst_uptimes.options -%}
   :{{ opt_name }}: {{ inst_uptimes.options[opt_name] | safe }}
   {% endfor -%}
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   
   Overview of uptimes of all stations generated with `obspy-scan`
{% endif %}
