GfzReport-Web tutorial (on current server)
==========================================

The :ref:`gfzw` is currently installed at GFZ on `st161dmz`. This is a fast tutorial
explaining how to do most common operations

.. _logintoserver:

Login to server
---------------

Assuming you have `generated an ssh key <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2>`_

.. code-block:: bash
   
   ssh sysop@st161dmz

.. _activatevirtualenv:

Activate virtualenv
-------------------

:ref:`gfzr` runs in an isolated python virtual environment. That is, the necessary python packages
(with needed versions) are not installed system wide to not create conflicts.
To Activate the virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   source /home/sysop/gfz-reportgen/bin/activate

      
Update the python package
-------------------------

When the package is modified, we need to update the server version. Firs :ref:`activatevirtualenv`.
Then:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /var/www/html/gfz-reportgen
   git pull
   
As the package has been installed as editable all modifications will take place without the
need to re-install :ref:`gfzr`, unless something in `setup.py` has changed. In this case
you need to re-install it:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .

and :ref:`restartserver`

.. _restartserver:

Restart the server
------------------

You need root privileges.

.. code-block:: bash

   su
   Password: [TYPE PASSWORD]
   service apache2 reload


.. _serverrootpath:

Root data path
--------------

All :ref:`gfzr` data files are located at:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   /data2/gfzreport

The directory structure is:
   
   * |DIR| /data2/gfzreport
  
         
      * |FILE| users.sqlite (the db storing users and sessions)
           
      * |FILE| users.txt (text json file where to add/remove/edit users)
      
      * |DIR| network (network report :ref:`webappdatapath`)
      
         * |DIR| source [#es1r]_
         
            - |DIR| ZE_2012 (:ref:`srcdir` of report ZE_2012)
            
            - |DIR| ...
            
         * |DIR| build [#es1r]_
            
            * |DIR| ZE_2012
            
               - |DIR| html  (the html :ref:`builddir` of report ZE_2012)
               
               - |DIR| latex (the latex :ref:`builddir` of report ZE_2012)
              
            * |DIR| ... 
                
      * |DIR| annual (annual report :ref:`webappdatapath`)

         * |DIR| source [#es1r]_
         
            - |DIR| 2016 (:ref:`srcdir` of report 2016)
            
            - |DIR| ... 
            
         * |DIR| build [#es1r]_
            
            * |DIR| 2016
            
               - |DIR| html  (the html :ref:`builddir` of report 2016)
               
               - |DIR| latex (the latex :ref:`builddir` of report 2016)
              
            * |DIR| ... 


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#es1r] Inside these directory, each folder whose name does not start with "_" is associated to a report

.. _wsgisfiles:

Wsgis directory
---------------

All :ref:`gfzw` wsgis files are located at:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   /var/www/html/gfz-reportgen/wsgis/
   
Apache conf directory
---------------------

All Apache configuration files are located at:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   /etc/apache2/conf-available/

Create a new report template (network report)
---------------------------------------------

This is the same operation described in :ref:`createnewtemplate`, but specific for the currently
installed Gfz network reports application.

We assume that a network name (e.g., 'ZE') and a network start year are given (e.g., 2012).
Ask the GEOFON responsible (currently Susanne) to produce the noise pdf(s)
and the instrument uptimes figure for you (this procedure could be in the future automatized and
implemented in :ref:`gfzt`)
Pdfs should have the format:

[station]-[channel].png

or, for stations with the same name:

[station]-[channel]-1.png, [station]-[channel]-2.png

(the number should match the station start time, e.g. between "AW-HHZ-1" and "AW-HHZ-5", the latter is more recent).

Actually, "-" can be any sequence of one or more non-alphanumeric characters (using "-" is maybe better to remember).

The instrument uptime figure can have any name.

Then choose a temp directory. Currently, we use directories of the type:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   /home/sysop/tmp_*

So for instance assuming the following data directories:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   /home/sysop/tmp_ZE
   /home/sysop/tmp_ZE/pdfs [directory of the noise pdfs]
   /home/sysop/tmp_ZE/uptime.png  [file of the instrument uptime]
   

You MUST :ref:`activatevirtualenv` and proceed as in :ref:`createnewtemplate`. Note that
the -o option points to the parent folder of the directory which is up to be created. E.g.:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   gfzreport template n -n ZE -s 2012 -p /home/sysop/tmp_ZE/pdfs -i /home/sysop/tmp_ZE/uptime.png \
      -o /data2/gfzreport/network/source

creates the directory /data2/gfzreport/network/source/ZE_2012. Therein, a file named
`gfzreport.template.log` will be also written: the file captures the standard output of the command,
which has also useful information on how the directory has been created. 

If there are users who need to edit the resport and do not have authorization, then
:ref:`modifydbusers`, otherwise :ref:`restartserver`.

Check that at http://st161dmz/gfzreport/network there is the button
corresponding to the newly created report

Note: the program accepts wildcards, but UNIX expands wildcards into the list of matching files
before calling our program, and that breaks the program functionality. Solution:
Escape wildcards with backslash, or avoid wildcards at all

.. _modifydbusers:

Modify users
------------

Go to :ref:`serverrootpath` and open with (e.g. vim), users.txt. There you will 
see :ref:`webappusers` for details) a json-like file. It is an array (list) of user, each
user being a json object (python dict). 

You normally want to add a user. Then add a line to the list such as:

.. code-block:: python

   [
     ...
     {"email": "tom@mysite.com", "path_restriction_reg": "/abc*$"}
   ]

Where "path_restriction_reg" indicates the authorization of the given user 'tom' (if missing, the user
has no restriction to editing). It is matched (using python `re.search` against each subdirectory
of each 'source' directory of each 'source' found in :ref:`datapath`.
You can also delete a line to delete the given user, or change "path_restriction_reg" for
an existing user.

To have the modification take effect, :ref:`restartserver` 

Update config only
-----------------

Sometimes, after a bug fix or whatever, we want to update the configuration files only.
Then do something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   gfzreport template n -n ZE -s 2012 -c -o /data2/gfzreport/network/source/


Cp source directory
------------------------

For each report, you can always navigate into the :ref:`serverrootpath` and copy a :ref:`srcdir`.
This will create a new report on the web page. This operation is a hack but might be useful
to copy a report and working on it for debugging. To do that, for instance to copy the annual
report '2016' into '2016_TEST':

.. code-block:: bash
   
   cp -r /data2/gfzreport/annual/source/2016 /data2/gfzreport/annual/source/2016_TEST 
   cd /data2/gfzreport/annual/source/2016_TEST/
   rm -rf .git

If you executed the above operations as root, remember to:
   
.. code-block:: bash
   
   cd /data2/gfzreport/annual/source
   chown -R sysop:sysop 2016_TEST


Toggle report editability
-------------------------

From within the gui, a report can be "locked", i.e. the report cannot be edited anymore. This
function has no particular consequence or security requirement, it is simply a feature requested
from the library. As such, we made a very simple implementation: for any report directory,
if a file with the same name and the suffix ".locked" exists, the report will be non-editable from within
the GUI. For instance, ZE_2012 is non -editable:

* |DIR| source 

   - |DIR| ZE_2012
   
   - |FILE| ZE_2012.locked
   
   - |DIR| IQ_2009
   
   - |DIR| ...

(see :ref:`serverrootpath` for details).

This makes relatively easy to un-lock a report after has been set non-editable (simply remove the relative .locked file),
as I suspect this
feature might be more dangerous than useful 


Install the web application on Apache
-------------------------------------

This should be the first section. However, as it was done once and should not be a problem
on the server, we collected some notes for future installations. Here what we did:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   install package as editable.
   Git pull on the gfzreport package to refresh new updates (restart apache in case)
   
   Create a folder wsgis (currently in the same git dir, untracked)
   Create the wsgis file you need by copying example.wsgi (and changing the paths accordingly), edit them
   current data path: /data2/gfzreport/network
   current db path: /data2/gfzreport  (users.sqlite will be created there)
   
   create users.txt in db path (see example.users.txt)
   
   
   Add apache cons files pointing to those wsgis
   
   Debug apache2 from the terminal:
   
   tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
   
   RESTART APACHE SERVER:
   service apache2 restart


Possible unused files
---------------------

The following files/ directories are not used anymore and should be deleted:

.. code-block:: bash

   /data2/gfz-reportgen_annual/
   /data2/gfz-reportgen/rizac  (but we should also remove the conf available. This I guess was the first report (not editable)
   /data2/gfz-report/  (old directory with the report data)
   /home/sysop/tmp_cesca_report/  (when simone report is done)
   /home/sysop/tmp_conffiles/  (or keep it, if we want to copy again conf_files and config.py in there from our sphinx directory)
