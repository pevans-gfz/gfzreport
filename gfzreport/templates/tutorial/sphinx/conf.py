# What THEY claim is that, if we want to avoid conflicts, we can set the next parameter to False
# What is TRUE is that, if we want to avoid latex 'undefined control sequence' errors, you better
# keep it to True (basically, sphinx 1.5.2 still issues old macro commands). Note that we do not
# upgrade to newer version of sphinx because currently (1.6+) they have a completely
# new latex templating system still under development. Waiting for that to be stable, we set:
