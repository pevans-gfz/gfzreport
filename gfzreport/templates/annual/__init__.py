           denoting the destination directory where to copy the files

        * `files`: a list of files to be copied in the corresponding `destdir`. It can
          be a list of strings denoting each a single file, a directory or a glob pattern.
          If string, it will be converted to the 1-element list `[files]`

        Use `collections.OrderedDict` to preserve the order of the keys

        Thus `filepath` can be a file (copy/move that file into `destdir`) a directory
        (copy/move each file into `destdir`) or a glob expression (copy/move each matching
        file into `destdir`)

            forwarded to this method

        :return: a dict of destination paths (ususally sub-directories of `self.destdatapath`
        mapped to lists of strings (files/ directories/ glob patterns). An empty dict or
        None (or pass) are valid (don't copy anything into `destdatadir`)
