    # It turns out that to do that we should run this function in a thread, return from the caller

    # not trivial so we gave up for the moment

    # Now (sorry for the verbosity but it's needed)
    # start the gfzreport build (gfz-build). We call sphinx-build and then, if the build
    # argument is 'pdf', we use python subprocess to invoke `pdflatex`.
    # Pdflatex returns 1 also in case the pdf
    # was written successfully, so we decided that the gfz-build
    # will return 0: doc created, no errs/warns;
    # 1: doc created with errs/ warns (either from sphinx-build or pdflatex). 2: build failed
    # (doc neither created nor newly modified).
    # Now for sphinx-build, we can easily rely on the returned value of sphinx build, especially
    # because sphinx checks outdated files only so the build can be successfull also when nothing
    # has been modified. Called R the sphinx-build return value, if R !=0, then R is set to 2.
    # Otherwise if R = 0, we will try to read the standard error (that we captured via
    # a `capturestderr` context manager): if an error is found (according to sphinx error format)
    # then R is set = 1, otherwise R is unchanged (0)
    # Note that in the first case (R!=0) we do not parse the standard error cause the sphinx error
    # format is not found (we have, e.g. "Exception occurred:...")
    # At this point if we do not need to run pdflatex, or R !=0, we return R.
    # If on the other hand we have to run pdflatex and R == 0, we run pdflatex
    # For pdflatex, as we said, we cannot rely on its exit status, as nonzero does not mean the
    # document has not been created. Thus, if the document has been created but pdflatex's
    # return value is nonzero, we return 1. If the document has not been created,
    # we reutrn 2, otherwise we return what pdflatex returned, i.e, 0.
    # This way we have a reliable and harmonized way to return the same values regardless of the
    # build type ('html', 'pdf', 'latex')
    # Side note: when the build type is 'pdf' and the document has been created, we read the
    # pdflatex og file into our captured standard error, converting the pdflatex errors into
    # the sphinx error format. Thus the standard error will also have normalized error format:
    # .+:[0-9]+ ERROR: .*

    # with the option "-file-line-error", the pdflatex errors are of the form:
