    Implements the sphinx directive imggrid:

    .. images-grid:: figure_caption
        :dir: folder

        data

    This directive has to be written and filled like a CSVTable BUT produces a "table" of figures.
    IT extends CsvFigureDirective, which in turn extends both CSVTable and Figure. It first parses
    the document as CSVTable,
    the returned table cell is replaced by images nodes first by joining the dir argument and the
    data provided. Then, the content is parsed as
    Figure directive, and we set the figure children as the table, followed by the caption (if any)
    Note that we need to process the image nodes inside the directive cause Sphinx understands that
    these images need to be copied to the build directory
    Thus the returned directive nodes are a simple figure wrapping a table of images, followed by
    all potential node messages that the super calls generated
    (appended as CSVTable + Figure messages).
    This lets previous labels written in the rst point to the figure (like 'see Fig...' and not
    'see Table...') and custom directives like tabularcolumns or tabularrows point to the wrapped
    table.

    If we had to generate html, that would be all we need. But there is latex, and sphinx pretending
    to support it. ;)

    Because images in a grid might overflow the page, and we need a reliable method to use
    longtables. And once we done that, we need to fix sphinx HARCODING headers and footers saying
    "Table # continued on next page" whereas we want "Figure # continued on next page".
    And now comes the BIG, BIG mess.
    First, Sphinx (1.4.1) claims it uses tabulary package for latex table. FALSE. It HARDCODES a
    rule that, if we provided a table class 'longtable' or, even worse, the table rows count exceeds
    30 (or 40, or whatever), then IT USES LONGTABLES.
    Ok, that's fine, we also want to use longtables, because we need latex to handle page overflow,
    which happens frequently, with a grid of images.
    So the class 'longtable' is appended to the returned table class by this directive.

    The second problem is to modify the longtable headers which print something like
    "Table # continued to next page", replacing that "Table" with "Figure" and # with the correct
    figure number. We do it via a hack (caused by a previous Sphinx hack) in
    depart_imggrid_node_latex function. Note that, as the figure will FOLLOW the table in latex,
    we use \addtocounter{figure}...

    Possible drawbacks: when latex places spaces or some other stuff BETWEEN the generated table and
    the figure. The latter, having only a caption, NEEDS to stay IMMEDIATELY below the table for
    giving the "visual" impression it is the table caption. But
    this can be arranged by editing the source rst and placing the directive elsewhere, or
    issuing a ':raw:latex \clearpage' command or simply writing some text which re-arranges the
    layout

    FIXME: write supported options. In principle, all Figure and CSVTAble options, PLUS the dir,
    latex-includegraphics-opts

    --------

    Small implementation history (in case you think "hey why don't you do like this?): we first
    implemented this directive as an
    extension of docutils.parsers.rst.directives.tables.ListTable, because it has a nice method
    to create table from string content. However, references to
    the table would appeared as "Table #", whereas this directive is intended, as the name says, to
    be an images grid *figure*. We then tried to return a figure wrapping a table, but this does not
    split if the table is too long (even with a longtable inside a figure). We then passed to a
    solution where we rendered this directive as a longtable followed by a "fake" figure without
    images but holding potential captions and allowing references within the text. Finally, we
    merged the last two tries: the rendering is STILL rendered as as a longtable followed by a
    "fake" figure, but the directive itself behaves like a CSVTable, so that we can add file names
    also in the directive content
