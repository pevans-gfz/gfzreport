Experiment design
-----------------

**Basic Design** The station distribution is shown in :numref:`stations_figure` and 
:numref:`stations_table` summarises the most important information about each station.

Three different types of instruments were used in this experiment. The main profile had a nominal
average station spacing of 17 km and was equipped EDL dataloggers and mostly CMG-3ESPs sensors.
A few Trillium 240s were approximately equally spaced throughout the array. The power to these
stations was supplied by solar panels. The permanent GEOFON station VOI forms an integral part
of the array, and no temporary station was deployed in the immediate neighbourhood.
The areal array comprises Cube data loggers and Mark L4C 1 Hz sensors. These stations ran off
batteries without recharging.

**Sensor orientation** All stations were oriented along magnetic north. The declination at the location
of station MS13 approximately at the centre of the array at the time of deployment (May 11, 2012) was
19°19' W, changing by 1'/year in west direction) (Source: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/
#declination). The azimuth of the nominal North components is thus ∼ 341°. This value is recorded
in the station metadata information in the GEOFON database; the variation of the magnetic field
through Madagascar has not been taken into account, though, but should be small compared to the
random orientation error.

-------------------
Data pre-processing
-------------------

The Cube data were converted to miniseed format using the c2m code written by Trond Ryberg 1 [X].
This code interpolates linearly between the raw data samples in order to ensure an even sampling rate
of the output file. It assumes a linear drift between GPS fixes, when GPS reception is temporarily
lost.

Data Quality
------------

An overview of instrument uptimes is given in :numref:`timing_accuracy` and the noise levels for all stations and components
are shown in :numref:`pdfs-images`.


Data recovery
-------------

A relatively large amount of data was lost due to vandalism ranging from loss of power because of
theft of the solar panels due to complete loss of data loggers. Some data was lost to technical issues,
probably related to high humidity at selected station sites. A recurring problem were GPS gaps at a
few of the Cube stations.
The security issues made it necessary to relocate some of the stations (MS06 and MS18, MS25
and AM16) and change the sensor type mid-experiment at some others (MS01, MS02, MS03, MS17,
MS25).

Timing accuracy
---------------

An overview of the timing accuracy is given for the broadband stations in :numref:`timing_accuracy`.
In spite of a large number of gaps without GPS for station MS09, MS24 and other stations, particularly in 2014, the
timing is thought to be correct for this station for standard seismological purposes.
However, based on inspections of the symmetry of the noise-correlation day stacks, the timing for
station MS05 was found to be off by 60 s between 02/10/2012 and 05/02/2013, such that the indicated
time is delayed with respect to the real time (equivalently seismic traces are apparently shifted to

.. _timing_accuracy:

earlier time). Data recorded in the period from 12/07/2012 to 29/09/2012 and from 06/02/2013 to
28/04/2013 only showed noise with no discernible seismic signals or ambient displacement noise. There
is no indication in the log files of any problem. Such errant behaviour in the EDL is rare but a known
phenomenon (T. Ryberg, pers. comm.). The timing of data in the GEOFON database was corrected
for the indicated time period and the bad data removed but it still appears on the noise power density
plots for station MS05 (:numref:`pdfs-images`).
The following short period stations had no GPS at the time of service, and last GPS fix was more
than 2 days in the past. The time after the last GPS fix cannot be corrected, and absolute timing
information should not be used between the last fix and indicated station service time; expected daily
drift is up to ∼ 10 ms/day [Ryberg, 2014]. [X]

The following short period stations had gaps in excess of 20 days, but a linear correction through the
gap could be carried out. Timing errors will be largest in the centre of the gap. The values given
in the last column represent these expected and maximum ‘largest errors’ based on the statistical
distribution of cube sensors during an experiment in Namibia [Ryberg, 2014] [X]. Gaps shorter than 20
days had expected errors of 5 ms and errors never exceeded 20 ms. No data exist on the likely timing
errors beyond 40 days. Actual errors encountered in the Madagascar experiment might differ.

lodge for providing intermediate storage space.
The funding for this experiment was provided by the expedition fund of the GFZ. Analysis of the
data is funded by the DFG. The data are additionally being used in the context of a DAAD sponsored
postdoctoral fellowhip to one of us (E. R.). Most of the instrumentation was provided by the GIPP
(Geophysical Instrument Pool Potsdam); the University of Potsdam loaned us solar panels.
