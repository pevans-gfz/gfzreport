# simple json file which sets up users and permissions
# (REMEBER TO QUOTE STRINGS WITH " AS THAT IS VALID JSON, NOT ')
# First of all, note that comments are not json standard. HOWEVER, any line
# starting with # will be removed from the parser implemented in this program.
# Specify below an array of users. Each array element:
#	- MUST BE A dict
#	- MUST contain a valid email (@ must be in email, neither in first nor last position)
# Any other field defined in models.py is optional. path_restriction_reg, if missing, will default to ".*", i.e.
# will give free access to the given user to all server paths. Otherwise, the regexp will be matched
# using re.search, which matches if the regex pattern matches ANY portion of a given path
# (so use ^ and $ if a match from the beginning or until the end is needed)
