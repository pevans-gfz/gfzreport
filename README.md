# gfz-reportgen
A sphinx-based report generation for use at gfz

## Installation

### Install this python package

Download the reportgen git repository in a local folder, cd into it and install this package:
	
```pip install .``` (with -e option as editable, if needed)

Now you should have all python packages installed, *except* [basemap](https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap) (python library to plot on map projections with	coastlines and political boundaries using matplotlib):

### Install basemap and dependencies

According to [basemap requirements](https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap#requirements): you should first make sure, if your python was installed via a package management system, that the corresponding "python-dev" package is also installed. Otherwise, you may not have the python header (Python.h), which is required to build python C extensions<sup>[1](#basemap_installation_notes)</sup>.

  1. Download basemap-1.0.7.tar.gz (*approx 100 mb*) from [here (see source code links in the page)](https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap/releases/tag/v1.0.7rel), unpack and cd to basemap-1.0.7:

  ```
  > cd <where you downloaded basemap basemap-1.0.7rel.tar.gz>
  > tar -zxvf basemap-1.0.7rel.tar.gz
  > cd basemap-1.0.7
  ```

  2. Install the GEOS library.  If you already have it on your system, just set the environment variable GEOS_DIR to point to the location of libgeos_c and geos_c.h (if libgeos_c is in /usr/local/lib and geos_c.h is in /usr/local/include, set GEOS_DIR to /usr/local):
  ```
  > export GEOS_DIR=<location of GEOS directory>
  ```
  Then go to next step.
  
  If you don't have it, you can build it from the source code included with basemap by following these steps:
  ```
  > cd geos-3.3.3
  > export GEOS_DIR=<where you want the libs and headers to go>
    A reasonable choice on a Unix-like system is /usr/local, or
    if you don't have permission to write there, your home directory.
  > ./configure --prefix=$GEOS_DIR 
  > make; make install
  ```

  3. cd back to the top level basemap directory (basemap-X.Y.Z) and run the usual 'python setup.py install'.  Check your installation by running "from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap" at the python prompt.
	
  4. To test, cd to the examples directory and run 'python simpletest.py'. To run all the examples (except those that have extra dependencies or require an internet connection), execute 'python run_all.py'.
   
### Install tex packages
Tex packages are required to run pdflatex for generating pdf output (we found it more robust and flexible than using builtin sphinx plugins):

```
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-bibtex-extra texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-humanities texlive-publishers
```

<a name="basemap_installation_notes">1</a>: <sub>We skipped some of the basemap requirements ([pyproj](https://github.com/jswhit/pyproj) and [pyshp](https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp)) as they do not seem to be mandatory for this program to run (keep it in mind in case of troubles though). Moreover, note that there are two optional packages which might be useful if you mean to use basemap outside this program:

  * <sub>[OWSLib](https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib) (optional) It is needed for the BaseMap.wmsimage function.</sub>

  * <sub>[Pillow](https://python-pillow.github.io/) (optional)  It is needed for Basemap warpimage, bluemarble, shadedrelief, and etop methods. PIL should work on Python 2.x.  Pillow is a maintained fork of PIL.</sub>
